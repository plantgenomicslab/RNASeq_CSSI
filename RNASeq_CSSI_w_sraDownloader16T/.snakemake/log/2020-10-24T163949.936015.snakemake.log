Job 13: ~-~ Downloading sra files... -~-

[Sat Oct 24 16:39:52 2020]
Error in rule sraDownload:
    jobid: 13
    output: output/SRA/
    shell:
        python src/sra_downloader.py -i data/passes.tsv -o output/SRA/
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job sraDownload since they might be corrupted:
output/SRA/
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
